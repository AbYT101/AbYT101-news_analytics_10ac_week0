# News Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains code for analyzing news data, including exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical analysis. The goal is to derive insights into relationships between news articles, websites, and various metrics such as sentiment, traffic, and content metadata.

## Project Structure

    - data/: Contains the datasets used for analysis, including data.csv, rating.csv, and traffic.csv.
    - notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for conducting analysis and visualizations.
    - src/: Python source code for data loading, preprocessing, and analysis.
    - requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies required to run the code.

## Usage

Explore the notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to understand the analysis process.
Run the notebooks or Python scripts in the src/ directory to perform loading tasks.
Modify the code to fit your specific analysis requirements and datasets.

### Configuration
Configure the package by modifying the src/config.py file. Adjust parameters such as file paths, API keys, or any other configuration settings relevant to your use case.

### Data Loading
The package provides a data loader module (loader.py) in the src directory. Use this module to load your network data into a format suitable for analysis.

## Task Completion

### Task 1
 
    - Created a GitHub repository named news_correlation_analysis.
    - Cleaned up the starter python package on a separate branch named task-01 to implement Task 1.
    - Committed changes with descriptive commit messages and pushed my changes.
